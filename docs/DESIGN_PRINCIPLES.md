# Design principles

Revise as the project matures. Defaults below are minimal—expand with rules for **your** codebase.

1. **Explicit contracts** — Document supported replayt (and third-party framework) versions; test integration boundaries.
   Supported replayt: ^0.1.0. Tested: React ^18.0.0, Vue ^3.0.0, Svelte ^4.0.0 (CI matrix).
2. **Small public surfaces** — Prefer narrow APIs and documented extension points.
3. **Observable automation** — Local scripts and CI produce clear logs and exit codes.
4. **Consumer-side maintenance** — Compatibility shims and pins live **here**; upstream changes are tracked with tests
   and changelog notes.
5. **Not a lever on core** — This repo does not exist to steer replayt core; propose upstream changes through normal
   channels.

## LLM / demos (if applicable)

N/A: Static demos/assets only (no model calls/secrets/costs).

## Audience (extend)

| Audience | Needs |
| -------- | ----- |
| **Maintainers** | Mission, scripts, pinned versions, release notes |
| **Integrators** | Stable adapter surface, compatibility matrix |
| **Contributors** | README, tests, coding expectations |
